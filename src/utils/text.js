  Dyscalculia is a learning disorder that dampens the ability to comprehend information based on numbers and general mathematics. Often developing in childhood between ages 6 and 9, dyscalculia affects approximately 3-7% of the global population. 

Dyscalculic patients often struggle with key mathematical concepts such as recognizing math symbols, sorting numbers in certain orders, and identifying quantities through vision. Symptoms may be linked to ADHD, Dyslexia, Dysgraphia, etc, and dyscalculic patients may experience anxiety and panic when required to facilitate mathematical operations.

As patients do not outgrow dyscalculia, difficulties with mathematics occur at all levels and ages, from young pre-k students to fully grown adults. Dyscalculia is not possible to prevent due to its unpredictable occurrence but is treatable upon early diagnosis and treatment through symptom-specific, one-on-one learning programs.

  Joshua(Kimyung) Song is a curious and passionate student from Lambert High School in the Atlanta Metropolitan Area, Georgia. Joshua has always been enthusiastic about helping peers in need and giving back to his community. Coupled with his affection for mathematics and his dedication to bringing positive impact to society, Joshua tutors refugee students to help overcome their academic barriers and adapt more easily to their education environment. 

Aspiring to bring further inclusion in the mathematics field, Joshua incorporated his passion in computer science to design a program that provides practice and assistance for students facing difficulties from Dyscalculia - a learning disorder that dampens the ability to comprehend information based on numbers. Further details regarding our vision and process for the Dyscalculia project can be found in this research paper. 

Joshua believes the Dyscalculia project will mark an initiative in resolving some of the various struggles that people face from mathematics. If there are any difficulties or general inquiries while using our program, please reach out to the following email: kmsongkor@gmail.com.
